# 🚂💥 The Ultimate Train Booking Database Challenge! 💥🚂

Welcome to the **Train Booking Database Challenge**! 🎉

In this project, we’re going to work together as a team to build a **train booking system database** from scratch. You’ll design tables, define relationships, and create a working model for a booking system that could *literally* power a train station! 🚉

### 📝 **What’s the Goal?**
We’re building a **train booking system database** where we:
1. **Design an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)** – Create entities like train stations, passengers, and bookings.
2. **Build the Database Schema** – Define tables, relationships, and constraints to keep things running smoothly.
3. **Populate with Data** – Fill it with real-world information to make sure it works perfectly.
4. **Share on GitHub** – Post everything in this repo for everyone to see!

### 💡 **Why Should You Join?**
This challenge is the perfect way to:
- Collaborate with your team to solve a real-world problem 🤝
- Improve your skills in database design and implementation 📊
- Have fun while building something useful 🚀

### ⏰ **Timeline**
We’ve got **4 days** to complete this challenge, so let’s make the most of it! 💪

#### Day 1: **Create the ERD**
- Define entities (train stations, passengers, bookings, etc.) and their relationships.
- Identify primary and foreign keys, and document the structure.

#### Day 2: **Design the Database Schema**
- Create tables, define constraints (primary keys, foreign keys), and ensure everything is in place.

#### Day 3: **Populate with Sample Data**
- Insert meaningful and realistic data to test the system’s integrity.
- Make sure everything connects properly.

#### Day 4: **Final Touches and Presentation**
- Finalize the database schema.
- Update the ERD if needed and get ready to present your hard work!

### 📁 **What’s Inside?**
- **ERD**: A clear visual representation of your database design.
- **booking.sql**: The SQL file that contains the schema and sample data.
- **GitHub Repo**: All your work will be hosted here for easy sharing and collaboration.

### 📚 **For More Details:**
For more detailed instructions and guidance on the project, you can reference this document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VNRqXbNTn4uviW5y9w9BvXsdbr5ZFGbNOUrWr4Rgep4/edit?usp=sharing

### 🏆 **Evaluation Criteria**
We’ll be judged based on the following:
- **Database Design (30%)**: Proper ERD implementation, correct use of primary and foreign keys.
- **Sample Data (20%)**: Meaningful and diverse data with correct foreign key relationships.
- **ERD (20%)**: Clear, readable, and accurate ERD reflecting the final schema.
- **Presentation (20%)**: Confidently explaining your design and how it works.
- **Adherence to Timeframe (10%)**: Meeting the 4-day deadline.

### 🚀 **Let’s Do This!**
Now, let’s get coding, designing, and having fun as we create the best train booking system ever! 🎉 

Don’t forget to **collaborate** with your team, keep everything organized, and let’s make this journey unforgettable! 🌟
